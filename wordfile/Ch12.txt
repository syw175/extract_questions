Essay

77. What are some of the advantages that outsourcing offers which is encouraging many companies to adopt it?
ANSWER:  	Outsourcing provides several advantages. These include:

(1) Access to skills and technologies: Organizations can gain access to specific skills and technologies by using outside resources. A project may require experts in a particular field for several months, or it might require specific technologies from an outside source. Planning for this procurement ensures that the needed skills and technologies will be available for the project.

(2) Reduces both fixed and recurrent costs: Outsourcing suppliers often can use economies of scale that may not be available to the client alone, especially for hardware and software. It can also be less expensive to outsource some labor costs to other organizations in the same country or offshore.

(3) Allows the client organization to focus on its core business: By outsourcing many IT functions, employees can focus on jobs that are critical to the success of the organization.
481
(4) Provides flexibility: Outsourcing to provide extra staff during periods of peak workloads can be much more economical than trying to staff entire projects with internal resources. Many companies cite better flexibility in staffing as a key reason for outsourcing.

(5) Increases accountability: A well-written contract can clarify responsibilities and sharpen focus on key deliverables of a project. Contracts are legally binding and thus there is more accountability for delivering the work as stated in the contract.

78. List and briefly describe the main processes of project procurement management.
ANSWER:  	The four main processes of project procurement management are as follows:

(1) Planning procurement management involves determining what to procure, when, and how. In procurement planning, one must decide what to outsource, determine the type of contract, and describe the work for potential sellers.

(2) Conducting procurements involves obtaining seller responses, selecting sellers, and awarding contracts.

(3) Controlling procurements involves managing relationships with sellers, monitoring contract performance, making changes as appropriate, and closing out contracts.

79. What are the four types of cost-reimbursable contracts? Briefly describe each type.
ANSWER:  	The four types of cost-reimbursable contracts are as follows:

(1) A cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) contract is one in which the buyer pays the supplier for allowable performance costs along with a predetermined fee and an incentive bonus. If the final cost is less than the expected cost, both the buyer and the supplier benefit from the cost savings, according to a negotiated share formula.

(2) A cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract is one in which the buyer pays the supplier for allowable performance costs plus a fixed fee payment usually based on a percentage of estimated costs. This fee does not vary, however, unless the scope of the contract changes.

(3) With a cost plus award fee (CPAF) contract, the buyer pays the supplier for allowable performance costs plus an award fee based on the satisfaction of subjective performance criteria. This type of contract is not usually subject to appeals.

(4) With a cost plus percentage of costs (CPPC) contract, the buyer pays the supplier for allowable performance costs along with a predetermined percentage based on total costs. From the buyer’s perspective, this is the least desirable type of contract because the supplier has no incentive to decrease costs.

80. How is a statement of work (SOW) different from a contract statement of work? What are some of the requirements for creating a contract SOW?
ANSWER:  	The statement of work (SOW) is a description of the work required for the procurement. If a SOW is used as part of a contract to describe only the work required for that particular contract, it is called a contract statement of work. The contract SOW is a type of scope statement that describes the work in sufficient detail to allow prospective suppliers to determine if they are capable of providing the goods and services required and to determine an appropriate price.

A contract SOW should be clear, concise, and as complete as possible. It should describe all services required and include performance reporting. It is important to use appropriate words in a contract SOW such as must instead of may. It should specify the products and services required for the project, use industry terms, and refer to industry standards.

It should specify the location of the work, the expected period of performance, specific deliverables and when they are due, applicable standards, acceptance criteria, and special requirements. A good contract SOW gives bidders a better understanding of the buyer’s expectations. A contract SOW should become part of the official contract to ensure that the buyer gets what the supplier bid on.

81. How are RFPs different from RFQs? What are some of the requirements of writing an RFP?
ANSWER:  	A Request for Proposal (RFP) is a document used to solicit proposals from prospective suppliers. On the other hand, A Request for Quote (RFQ) is a document used to solicit quotes or bids from prospective suppliers.

Developing an RFP is often a time-consuming process. Organizations must plan properly to ensure that they adequately describe what they want to procure, what sellers to include in their proposals, and how they will evaluate proposals. To generate a good RFP, expertise is invaluable. It is thus important to consult with experts who know the contract planning process for particular organizations. Legal requirements are often involved in issuing RFPs and reviewing proposals, especially for government projects. To make sure that an RFP has enough information to provide the basis for a good proposal, the buying organization should try to put itself in the suppliers’ shoes.

82. What are the four main capabilities of procure-to-pay suites for indirect procurements?  What type(s) of organizations are they suitable for?
ANSWER:  	The four main capabilities of procure-to-pay suites for indirect procurements include:

E-purchasing functionality: This provides a self-service solution to requisition and order goods and services through the use of catalogs, e-forms, or free-text orders (for when users cannot find items in a structured format).

Catalog management capabilities: Includes catalog content upload, content update evaluation tools, and catalog search tools.

E-invoicing: Enables the interchange and storage of legally valid invoices in electronic format.

Accounts Payable Invoice Automation (APIA): Allows approval and control of incoming invoices through either automatic or manual approvals by automatic workflows.

At current software suite prices, organizations with annual revenues of $800 million or more usually realize a good return on investment from using these tools.
