84. What is a systems development life cycle? What are some of the predictive models associated with the systems development life cycle?
ANSWER:  	A systems development life cycle (SDLC) is a framework for describing the phases of developing information systems. In addition to the waterfall model for the SDLC, other predictive life cycles include the spiral model, the prototyping model, and the Rapid Application Development (RAD) model. The project team spends a large portion of the project attempting to clarify the requirements of the entire system and then producing a design. Users are often unable to see any tangible results in terms of working software for an extended period. Below are brief descriptions of several predictive SDLC models:

The waterfall life cycle model has well-defined, linear stages of systems development and support. This life cycle model assumes that requirements will remain stable after they are defined.

The spiral life cycle model was developed based on refinements of the waterfall model as applied to large government software projects. It recognizes the fact that most software is developed using an iterative or spiral approach rather than a linear approach.

The prototyping life cycle model is used for developing software prototypes to clarify user requirements for operational software. It requires heavy user involvement, and developers use a model to generate functional requirements and physical design specifications simultaneously. Developers can throw away or keep prototypes, depending on the project.

The RAD life cycle model uses an approach in which developers work with an evolving prototype. This life cycle model also requires heavy user involvement and helps produce systems quickly without sacrificing quality. Developers use RAD tools such as CASE (computer-aided software engineering), JRP (joint requirements planning), and JAD (joint application design) to facilitate rapid prototyping and code generation.

Essay

85. Discuss four key issues project managers must address when working on global projects.
ANSWER:  	Communications. Because people work in different time zones, speak different languages, have different cultural backgrounds, and celebrate different holidays, it is important to address how people will communicate in an efficient and timely manner.

Trust. Trust is an important issue for all teams, especially when they are global teams. It is important to start building trust immediately by recognizing and respecting others' differences and the value they add to the project.
