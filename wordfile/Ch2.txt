Essay

80. Describe the concept of a systems approach.
ANSWER:  	The term systems approach emerged in the 1950s to describe a holistic and analytical approach to solving complex problems that includes using a systems philosophy, systems analysis, and systems management. A systems philosophy is an overall model for thinking about things as systems.

Systems are sets of interacting components working within an environment to fulfill some purpose. For example, the human body is a system composed of many subsystems, including the nervous system, the skeletal system, the circulatory system, and the digestive system. Systems analysis is a problem-solving approach that requires defining the scope of the system, dividing it into its components, and then identifying and evaluating its problems, opportunities, constraints, and needs. Once this is completed, the systems analyst then examines alternative solutions for improving the current situation, identifies an optimum, or at least satisfactory, solution or action plan; and examines that plan against the entire system. Systems management addresses the business, technological, and organizational issues associated with creating, maintaining, and modifying a system.

81. What are the four frames of organizations? Describe each frame.
ANSWER:  	The structural frame deals with how the organization is structured (usually depicted in an organizational chart) and focuses on different groups’ roles and responsibilities in order to meet the goals and policies set by top management. This frame is very rational and focuses on coordination and control. For example, within the structural frame, a key IT issue is whether a company should centralize the IT personnel in one department or decentralize across several departments.

The human resources (HR) frame focuses on producing harmony between the needs of the organization and the needs of the people. It recognizes that mismatches can occur between the needs of the organization and those of individuals and groups, and works to resolve any potential problems. For example, many projects might be more efficient for the organization if personnel worked 80 or more hours a week for several months. However, this work schedule would conflict with the personal lives and health of many employees. Important IT issues related to the human resources frame are the shortage of skilled IT workers within the organization and unrealistic schedules imposed on many projects.

The political frame addresses organizational and personal politics. Politics in organizations take the form of competition among groups or individuals for power and leadership. The political frame emphasizes that organizations are coalitions composed of varied individuals and interest groups. Often, important decisions need to be made based on the allocation of scarce resources. Competition for resources makes conflict a central issue in organizations, and power improves the ability to obtain those resources. Project managers must pay attention to politics and power if they are to be effective. It is important to know who opposes your projects as well as who supports them. Important IT issues related to the political frame are the differences in power between central functions to operating units or between functional managers to project managers.

The symbolic frame focuses on symbols and meanings. In this frame, the most important aspect of any event in an organization is not what actually happened, but what it means. Was it a good sign that the CEO came to a kick-off meeting for a project, or was it a threat? The symbolic frame also relates to the company’s culture. How do people dress? How many hours do they work? How do they run meetings? Many IT projects are international and include stakeholders from various cultures. Understanding those cultures is also a crucial part of the symbolic frame.

82. Describe each of the three major types of organizational structure.
ANSWER:  	A functional organizational structure is the hierarchy most people think of when picturing an organizational chart. Functional managers or vice presidents in specialties such as engineering, manufacturing, IT, and human resources (HR) report to the chief executive officer (CEO). Their staffs have specialized skills in their respective disciplines. For example, most colleges and universities have very strong functional organizations. Only faculty in the business department teach business courses; faculty in the history department teach history; faculty in the art department teach art, and so on.

A project organizational structure also is hierarchical, but instead of functional managers or vice presidents reporting to the CEO, program managers report to the CEO. Their staffs have a variety of skills needed to complete the projects within their programs. An organization that uses this structure earns their revenue primarily from performing projects for other groups under contract. For example, many defense, architectural, engineering, and consulting companies use a project organizational structure. These companies often hire people specifically to work on particular projects.

A matrix organizational structure represents the middle ground between functional and project structures. Personnel often report to both a functional manager and one or more project managers. For example, IT personnel at many companies often split their time between two or more projects, but they report to their manager in the IT department. Project managers in matrix organizations have staff from various functional areas working on their projects. Matrix organizational structures can be strong, weak, or balanced, based on the amount of control exerted by the project managers.

83. Why is top management commitment crucial for project managers?
ANSWER:  	Project managers need adequate resources. The best way to kill a project is to withhold the required money, human resources, and visibility for the project. If project managers have top management commitment, they will also have adequate resources and not be distracted by events that do not affect their specific projects.

Project managers often require approval for unique project needs in a timely manner. For example, on large IT projects, top management must understand that unexpected problems may result from the nature of the products being developed and the specific skills of the people on the project team. The team might need additional hardware and software halfway through the project for proper testing, or the project manager might need to offer special pay and benefits to attract and retain key project personnel. With top management commitment, project managers can meet these needs.

Project managers must have cooperation from people in other parts of the organization. Because most IT projects cut across functional areas, top management must help project managers deal with the political issues that often arise. If certain functional managers are not responding to project managers’ requests for necessary information, top management must step in to encourage functional managers to cooperate.

Project managers often need someone to mentor and coach them on leadership issues. Many IT project managers come from technical positions and are inexperienced as managers. Senior managers should take the time to pass on advice on how to be good leaders. They should encourage new project managers to take classes to develop leadership skills and allocate the time and funds for managers to do so.

84. What is a systems development life cycle? What are some of the predictive models associated with the systems development life cycle?
ANSWER:  	A systems development life cycle (SDLC) is a framework for describing the phases of developing information systems. In addition to the waterfall model for the SDLC, other predictive life cycles include the spiral model, the prototyping model, and the Rapid Application Development (RAD) model. The project team spends a large portion of the project attempting to clarify the requirements of the entire system and then producing a design. Users are often unable to see any tangible results in terms of working software for an extended period. Below are brief descriptions of several predictive SDLC models:

The waterfall life cycle model has well-defined, linear stages of systems development and support. This life cycle model assumes that requirements will remain stable after they are defined.

The spiral life cycle model was developed based on refinements of the waterfall model as applied to large government software projects. It recognizes the fact that most software is developed using an iterative or spiral approach rather than a linear approach.

The prototyping life cycle model is used for developing software prototypes to clarify user requirements for operational software. It requires heavy user involvement, and developers use a model to generate functional requirements and physical design specifications simultaneously. Developers can throw away or keep prototypes, depending on the project.

The RAD life cycle model uses an approach in which developers work with an evolving prototype. This life cycle model also requires heavy user involvement and helps produce systems quickly without sacrificing quality. Developers use RAD tools such as CASE (computer-aided software engineering), JRP (joint requirements planning), and JAD (joint application design) to facilitate rapid prototyping and code generation.

85. Discuss four key issues project managers must address when working on global projects.
ANSWER:  	Communications. Because people work in different time zones, speak different languages, have different cultural backgrounds, and celebrate different holidays, it is important to address how people will communicate in an efficient and timely manner.

Trust. Trust is an important issue for all teams, especially when they are global teams. It is important to start building trust immediately by recognizing and respecting others' differences and the value they add to the project.

Common work practices. It is important to align work processes and develop a modus operandi with which everyone agrees and is comfortable.

Tools. IT pays a vital role in globalization, especially in enhancing communications and work practices. Many people use free tools such as Skype, Google Docs or social media to communicate.  Many project management software tools include their own communications and collaboration features in an integrated package.
